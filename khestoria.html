            Khestoria was my first venture into creating a real gaming experience 
            and is one of my favorite projects that I have worked on. For this, I worked
            on a very small team of three, using <b>Gamemaker Studio 2</b>. 
            <br> <br> With such a small team, we were all given opportunities to take 
            on a lot of work as well as wear many hats throughout development. For my 
            contribution, I decided to take up a lot of the programming with some of 
            the art, as it seemed to be good experience for someone interested in 
            tech-art. To start off with, I worked to develop the home screen along with 
            creating <b>sprite-sheets</b> for the enemy slimes. I also worked to 
            add item drops to slimes upon dying and collision detection along with 
             room transitions for a smoother player experience. I implemented 
             <b>UI Elements</b> as well including the look and functionaly of the clock, 
             day-time dial, health, and stamina of the player.
            <br> <br> Lastly, I used the opportunity to learn to implment some standard player 
            systems. These systems include a <b>day/night cycle</b> that implements shaders
            based on the time of day and allow for tracking which allows for in-game crops 
            to grow. The second system created is a <b>dialogue system</b> that allows for multiple
            responses and branching dialogue. Lastly, I worked to implement the <b>enemy AI</b> as 
            well as a <b>combat system</b> inluding player feedback whenever damage is taken or dealt.
            <br><br> Overall, this was my favorite project I have worked on so far. Having
            a small team allowed for creative flexibility and allowed all group 
            members to take on work that they were interested in. Below are Screenshots
            from the project followed by the release trailer.

            Following the final submission for this project, our instructor had very high praise
            regarding our group's work, which I have taken as inspiration to continue with 
            development in my future.
            <br> <br> 
            <em>
            "This is so awesome -- of all the games in the class, this one perhaps has the most 
            commercial-ready feel. The polish on what's here is incredibly high, and it has a 
            sense of being a demo for a much larger project. <br> In a way, that's what I really 
            like to see most for this course: hitting a high artistic bar that sits next to critically
            and commercially successful titles. Given where this project is, I have confidence you 
            could finish it out at the existing quality given the time. Overall, extremely excellent 
            work. Aside from the above, I'm really impressed with how you've all grown as developers. 
            You tackled some extremely tricky issues this semester around collaboration in a creative 
            and technically complex environment. Reflecting on those experiences will serve you well 
            as professionals. I'm stoked to see what your future projects hold. In the meantime, 
            enjoy some well deserved down time. :&#41" - Matt A.</em>
